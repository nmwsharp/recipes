## Ingredients

- 1/2 gal apple cider
- 1/2 cup pineapple juice
- 1/2 fresh orange, sliced (with peel)
- 2 tsp lemon juice
- 3 cinnamon sticks
- 1.5 tsp whole cloves
- 1/2 of a nutmeg, ground/smashed (or 1/2 tsp nutmeg powder)

## Ingredients

Combine all ingredients and heat. The spices will get stronger over the next few hours,
I suggest waiting at least 2 hours to drink. Strain it out to pour in to cups.  

Make sure it's hot but not too hot (I use roughly 175F). If there is A LOT of steam coming off of the pot then the liquid is evaporating too fast and it will quickly get syrupy.

Recipe originally from Aunt Nan!
