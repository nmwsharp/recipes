## Ingredients

- 1.5-2 lbs fresh okra (or 2 16oz bags frozen okra)
- 1 Tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper
- 1 tsp tumeric
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp coriander
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper

## Directions

Preheat oven to 450F (or 425F for convection).

If using fresh okra: wash and dry, trim both ends off, and cut into roughly 1/2inch chunks. If using frozen okra: no prep needed, use frozen directly from bag.

Combine all spices together. Put okra in a medium bowl, toss with oil, then toss with spices.

Lightly grease a baking sheet (or just line with foil, it usually doesn't stick). Spread out the okra on the baking sheet. Bake for 15-25 minutes, until okra is browned and crunchy but not yet blackened on the bottom.
