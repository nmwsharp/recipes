## Ingredients

- 1.5 cups basmati rice
- 1 small onion, thinly sliced
- 2 Tbsp neutral oil (or ghee)
- 1 whole cinnamon stick
- 2 pods green cardamom
- 2 whole cloves
- 1 Tbsp cumin seed

Rinse rice. Place rice in a bowl with enough water to cover, let sit while doing remaining steps. If using a rice cooker, you can use the rice cooker bowl for this.

Heat oil in a medium-sized pot with lid (or fry pan, if using rice cooker). Add cinnamon stick, cardamom, cloves, and cumin seed. Stir and cook for 30sec.

Add onions and stir. Continue cooking until onion is golden, about 10min.

Drain the water from the rice, add to pan and cook until lightly toasted, about 3min. Add salt.

To cook on stovetop: add the 2.5 cups water to the pot, bring to simmer, stir, and cover. Simmer until water is absorbed.

To cook on ricecooker: transfer to cooker, add the 2.5 cups water, and cook on the usual white rice setting.

Cook and serve!
