## Ingredients

- 2 cups (240g) flour
- 3 Tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 egg
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 2 Tbsp butter, melted
- (optional) 1.5 tsp vanilla extract
- spray oil or butter

## Directions

In a medium-large bowl, combine dry ingredients and whisk.

In a separate bowl, combine egg, buttermilk, butter, and vanilla. Whisk vigorously.

Add wet ingredients to dry. Whisk gently to combine, enough that the mixture is smooth with a few small lumps. Don't over-mix at this stage.

Let the batter sit for 10-15 minutes while you get your griddle ready.

Preheat an electric griddle or skillet on the stove. I use 325F on the electric griddle.

Lightly grease griddle with spray oil or butter. Spoon ~1/3cup blobs of batter onto the griddle. Cook for ~2min until you see bubbles and they are brown on the bottom. Flip and cook for ~2min more until done.
