## Ingredients

- 1.5 lbs ground beef 
- 1/2 lbs chorizo sausage (not in casing)
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 15oz can black beans (strain out ~half the juice)
- 1 15oz can kidney beans (strain out ~half the juice)
- 1 14oz can diced tomatoes  (dump entire can)
- 1 14oz can stewed tomatoes (dump entire can)
- 2 jalapenos, seeded and diced
- 1/2 bottle of beer (IPA works great)
- 2 shots whiskey
- 3 Tbsp chili powder
- 1+ teaspoons cayenne
- 1 Tbsp cumin
- black pepper

Note: I often make a double batch of this recipe, which ends up being about 12 bowls of chili.

## Directions

Put a large pot over medium heat with all of the canned ingredients, everything gets added in here as it is ready.

Brown the meat with some of the chili powder. Leave some of the fat in the pan, and use it to saute onions until they are starting to caramelize, adding the garlic with about 5 minutes to go.

Deglaze the pan with the whiskey and beer, reduce slightly, and add the mixture to the pot.

Add the remaining spices (but not the jalapenos) to the pot. I normally add about 1 tsp of cayenne now, then add more in later to taste.

Simmer for about 2 hours. Keep it just barely boiling and stir every ~20 minutes to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom.

Add jalapenos. Simmer for at least another hour. It's chili -- serve it whenever you damn please.
