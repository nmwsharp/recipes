2 lbs ground beef (italian sausage works meh too. Some of both? Chuck roast [will need to cook longer]?)
1 large yellow onion, diced (how fine of a dice is up to you)
~4 cloves garlic, minced
1 15oz can black beans (strain out ~half the juice)
1 15oz can kidney beans (strain out ~half the juice)
1 14oz can diced tomatoes  (dump entire can)
1 14oz can stewed tomatoes (dump entire can)
2 jalapenos, seeded and diced
1/2 bottle of beer (IPA works great)
~2 shots whiskey
~3-4 tblspoon chili powder
~1+ teaspoons cayenne
~1 tblspoon cumin
black pepper


I start by browning the meat with half of the chili powder over medium-high heat in batches to give it room to sizzle and get a bunch of crunchy bits in there. If using steak, I'll dice it first, and if sausage, I'll remove the casing and break it up by hand. Make sure to not crowd the pan, or you'll end up braising the meat in its own juices which, while tasty, isn't as good. If you're in a hurry (why are you making chili), just go to town. It's not the end of the world.

Once the meat is browned, I remove it from the pan and start sauteeing the diced onion.

After a couple minutes, I add the garlic and let that sautee for a very short while (it'll burn fast) before deglazing the pan with a bit of beer and a shot of whiskey.

Once the beer/whiskey's done its job, re-add the meat, adding the beans, tomatoes, jalapenos, cumin, and the rest of the chili powder. Mash up any excessive bits of stewed tomato.

Once everything's mixed up, I reduce the heat to medium-low and wait for about a half hour before adding in the cayenne, about a half teaspoon at a time, tasting after 10 minutes to see if I'm happy with the heat.
Once I'm happy with everything, I let it simmer at low heat, covered, for an hour or two before adding the bell peppers.

After about a half hour, I kill the heat and let the residual take it the rest of the way for about 20 minutes.
I serve over rice, biscuits, cornbread, or on its own with shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and diced red onion
