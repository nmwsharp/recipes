## Ingredients

- 2lbs sweet potatoes
- 2 Tbs olive oil
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

## Directions

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Peel potatoes if the skin bothers you. Slice potatoes in to strips 1/4 inch wide.

Mix spices with oil, toss with potatoes in large bowl.

Spread fries on baking sheet; be sure to leave lots of space between and use two sheets if needed.

Bake ~30 minutes, flipping halfway through. If not crisping, broil for ~3 minutes at the end (but be careful, they burn fast while broiling).


## Notes

- 1 potato each is decent serving

- Consider adding: cayenne

- Possibly use oil spritzer to cut down on oil?
