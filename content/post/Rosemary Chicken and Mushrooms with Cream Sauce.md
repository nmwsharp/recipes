## Ingredients

- 3 large boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 4 tbs butter, divided
- 1 tbs olive oil
- 10 oz package baby portabella mushrooms
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1.5 cup chicken stock
- 1 tsp crushed rosemary (or 1 large bruised sprig fresh)
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 tsp thyme
- 1/2 cup heavy cream (use less if you want to live past 50)
- pasta noodles of your choice

Seasoned Flour:

- 1 cup flour
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp pepper
- 2 tsp garlic powder


## Instructions

1. Slice chicken in to thin strips roughly 2"x1".

2. Mix the seasoned flour ingredients together in a gallon plastic bag.

5. Add chicken to bag and shake vigorously to coat. Cook through in a skillet with half of butter. While these are cooking, cook the mushrooms separately in the next two steps.

3. Clean and cut mushrooms in to large slices.

4. Heat remaining 2 tbs of butter and the 1 tbs of olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add mushrooms, sauteing until most liquid has evaporated. Add the garlic with roughly 5 minutes remaining.

7. Once the chicken is done cooking, add the 1 cup of stock and the rosemary to deglaze the pan. Add mushrooms to this pan.

8. Cover, reduce heat and cook for 20 minutes until liquid has reduced and thickened significantly. Also start boiling water for noodles at this point.

9. If using fresh rosemary, pick out the sprigs at this point.

9. Add the cream and heat through over medium-low heat until the sauce is reduced by 25%. This should only take about 5 minutes after it begins to bubble.

10. Spoon mixture over pasta and enjoy.
