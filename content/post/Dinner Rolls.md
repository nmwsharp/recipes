Makes 12 rolls. Total time: 1.5-2 hrs. Adapted from King Arthur.

## Ingredients


- 1/4 cup [56g] water, lukewarm
- 1 cup [227g] milk, lukewarm (~105F)
- 1.5 Tbs [22g] butter, room temperature
- 1 Tbs [10g] sugar
- 1/2 Tbs [9g] salt
- 1.25 Tbs [14g] instant yeast
- 3-3.5 cups [360g-422g] AP flour
- cooking oil spray (pam, etc)

## Directions

Combine the water, milk, butter, sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl. Stir and let sit for 6 to 8 minutes, until yeast foams.

Add 2.5 cups of flour and mix by hand to form a shaggy mass.

Slowly incorporate remaining flour while kneading, until a soft, smooth, and slightly tacky ball forms. Knead for about 10min total by hand, or 5 min on a mixer.

Spray a bowl with cooking oil and transfer dough to it. Lightly spray the top of the dough as well, then cover.  Let rise for 20min, or until dough is full and ouffy.

Deflate the dough, and pat it out in to a rectangle on a counter. Split in to 12 equal pieces, and form tight round balls.

Place the rolls in a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Cover and let rise for another 20 minutes, until rounded and full. Preheat the oven to 350F.

Bake for 20-25 min, until golden brown. If desired, brush with butter after baking.
