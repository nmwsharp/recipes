## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp canola, vegetable or avocado oil
- 2 lbs boneless skinless chicken, cubed
- 1/2 yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp coriander
- 1/2 tsp kosher sea salt
- 1/4 tsp oregano
- juice of 2 oranges
- juice of 2 limes
- 1/2 jalape√±o, minced (or a whole pepper if you prefer slightly spicier)
- 1/2 c. fresh cilantro

## Directions

Saute chicken with a small amount of oil and garlic. We don't need to cook through, just brown the outside.

Add chicken and all remaining ingrdients to pressure cooker. Cook on high (instant pot "poultry" setting) for 12 minutes. Immediately release pressure using an oven mitt and wait for steam to release.

Saute the mixture until almost all remaining liquid is gone (can use instant pot "saute" setting).

Shred using utensils or bowl mixer. Use to make quesadillas, tacos, or any other delicious thing!
