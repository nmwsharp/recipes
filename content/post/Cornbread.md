## Ingredients

- 2 boxes Jiffy cornbread muffin mix
- 2 eggs
- 1/3 cup milk
- 1 can creamed corn
- 1 tbs sugar
- butter (to grease skillet)

If you can't get Jiffy cornbread mix, substitute with:

- 1 & 1⁄3 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup yellow cornmeal
- 1⁄3 cup sugar
- 2 Tbs baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 4 Tbs vegetable oil

## Directions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Find a cast iron skillet.

Combine all ingredients in bowl. Mix and allow to sit for a few minutes. While the batter sits, place the skillet in the oven for a few minutes to get hot.

Take out the skillet and coat the inside with butter (or other fat). Pour in the batter (it should sizzle a little!) and return the skillet to the oven. Bake for 25-35 minutes, until the top of the cornbread is brown and cracking. Let cool for 30 min before serving, if possible.
