## Ingredients

- 2 boxes Jiffy cornbread muffin mix
- 2 eggs
- 1/3 cup milk
- 1 can creamed corn
- 1 tbs Sugar
- butter (to grease skillet)

## Directions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Find a cast iron skillet, and put it in the oven to get hot.

Combine all ingredients in bowl. Mix and allow to sit for a few minutes.

Take out the skillet and coat the inside with butter (or other fat). Pour in the batter (it should sizzle!) and return the skillet to the oven. Bake for 25-35 minutes, until the top of the cornbread is brown and cracking. Let cool for 30 min before serving, if possible.
