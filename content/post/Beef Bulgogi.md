## Ingredients

- 1 pound meat (almost any beef/pork/chicken will work, flank steak is my favorite)
- 1/4 pear, grated  (Bosc pears & Asian pears work well, but any will work)
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp gochugaru (Korean red pepper powder)
- 1/2 Tbsp grated peeled ginger
- 1 Tbsp brown sugar
- 1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil
- vegetable oil (for cooking)
- salt (for cooking)

(for serving)
- 1 head butter lettuce
- white rice


## Instructions

Slice meat in to thin strips.  If you're having trouble slicing, try sticking the meat in the freezer for a while beforehand.

Combine pear, garlic, soy sauce, gochugaru, brown sugar, and sesame oil in a large bowl/bag and toss with meat strips. Marinate in the fridge for anywhere from 30 min to 8 hrs.

Cook rice and wash lettuce for serving.

Place a cast iron pan or heavy skillet over medium heat with a little oil to coat the bottom. Keep the pan as hot as you can without the oil smoking.

Working in batches, grab some meat with tongs, shake off excess marinade, and place in the pan in a single layer (don't crowd the pan!). Season with a pinch of salt, and cook for 2-4 minutes until browned. Toss the meat meat once or twice while cooking, but mostly just let it sit so it browns. Once done, transfer the batch to a separate bowl. Add a little more oil to the pan after each batch.

Serve meat with rice and lettuce to make wraps.
