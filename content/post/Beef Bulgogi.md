## Ingredients
- 1.5 lb beef (flank, sirloin, or strip cuts usually)
- 1 large zucchini
- peanut oil (or similar, for cooking)
- 1/3 cup soy sauce
- 3 Tbsp brown sugar
- 1 medium yellow onion (chopped long and thin, divided)
- 2 stalks green onion (chopped)
- 1/2 asian pear (peeled and chunked)
- 1 Tbsp sesame oil
- 2 Tbsp sesame seeds
- 2 Tbsp minced garlic
- 1 Tbsp sriracha sauce
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 2 tsp Korean red pepper powder ("gochugaru")
- black pepper


## Instructions

- Slice beef in to long thin strips. These should basically be as thin as you can get them by hand. It may help to put the meat in the freezer for a short time (30-60 minutes) right beforehand, as it firms up the beef and makes it easier to slice.

- Make the marinade from all ingredients except beef, zucchini, and peanut oil. Reserve half of the chopped onion, and blend everything else together, then add in the remaining onion.

- Place the beef and marinade in a large container, mix thoroughly then marinade in the refrigerator for 2-24 hours, agitating occasionally.

- When ready to prepare, remove the meat from the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature approximately an hour ahead of time.

- Place some peanut oil in a hot wok, and cook the strips of beef. Remove the beef from the marinade with tongs to avoid getting too much liquid in the pan and steaming the meat rather than searing it. Do several batches as necessary to avoid crowding the pan. The beef should cook quite quickly ~3-5 minutes per batch. Mix the zucchini in to each batch about half way through, and at the very end of the batch add in some of the sauce to heat and combine.

- Serve over rice and be happy.
