## Ingredients

- 1 bag of stuffing mix
- EVOO
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 lb sausage
- 1 cup craisins
- Fresh mushrooms
- 1 onion
- 1 celery piece
- 1 carrot
- 3/4 cup white wine
- Chopped fresh thyme
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 1 clove garlic

## Directions

Preheat oven to 375

Coat a large wide pot with olive oil and toss in the celery and onions. Season with salt and cook the veggies over medium-high heat until soft and very aromatic, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and butter and cook for 3 to 4 minutes

Add the sausage and cook, breaking into really small pieces until brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes

Add the white wine and cook until it has evaporated by half. (The mix will be pretty soupy)

Combine the bread with the sausage mixture in a large bowl. Toss in the craisins and thyme and pour about half the chicken stock into the bowl. Work to combine everything well. Add the remaining stock as needed to create a moist mix. Taste and season with salt

Transfer the mixture to a 9 X 13 in baking dish and cover with foil. Bake 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake to brown the top, another 15 minutes
