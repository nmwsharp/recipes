## Ingredients

- 2/3 lb salmon fillets, skin on or off (usually cut to two 1/3 lb fillets)
- 1 Tbsp ground coriander
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
- 1.5 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1 lemon wedge
- salt & pepper
- splash of oil for cooking (high-heat neutral oils like avocado are best, but vegetable or olive oil will work fine)


## Directions

Pat fillets dry with a paper towel. You can leave skin on if you like it, cooks nicely in this recipe.

Season fillets generously on all sides with salt and pepper. Combine all other spices into a mixture, then pat the mixture onto all sides of the salmon. You should have more than a dusting, but less than a thick crust, you may not use all of the mixture.

Add 1Tbs cooking oil to a nonstick skillet, heat over medium-high until oil shimmers. Place fillets in oil skin-side down and cook for 2-3 minutes. Flip, then cook for another 2-3 minutes, until the crust is brown and salmon is just starting to flake apart.

Remove salmon from pan, (optionally) pat off any excess oil with a paper towel, and season with a light squeeze of lemon. Serve immediately.
