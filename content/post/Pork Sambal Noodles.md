## Ingredients

- 1 lb. ground pork, divided
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1" ginger, peeled and minced
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1 Tbsp tomato paste
- ~3 fresh basil leaves
- 3 Tbsp sambal oelek
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter
- 8oz ramen noodles
- salt & pepper

## Directions

Heat a olive oil in a large pot (dutch oven works well). Add half the pork, breaking into small chunks. Cook, turning only when needed for 5-10 minutes until browned on all sides.

Add garlic, ginger, sugar, and remaining pork. Cook for another 5 minutes.

Add tomato paste and basil, continue cooking for 3 more minutes.

Add sambal oelek, soy sauce, vinegar, and 1 cup water. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Cook uncovered for 30-35min, stirring occasionally. Sauce should thicken slightly, if it cooks down too much and wants to burn add more water.

Cook pasta according to package instructions, drain and save some pasta water. Add to pasta sauce pot along with butter and toss to combine. Simmer for 1 min. Add a little pasta water as needed to get the consistency right.
