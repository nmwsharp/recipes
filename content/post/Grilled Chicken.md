## Ingredients

**Chicken:**
- 1.5 lbs chicken breast



**Marinade:**
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup lemon juice (half a lemon is close enough)
- 3 cloves garlic, grated/pressed/chopped
- 1 tsp dried rosemary
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 2 tsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp dijon or brown mustard
- 2 tsp Worchestershire sauce

All ingredients in the marinade (except oil) should be treated as optional and approximate. Don't hesitate to add, remove, or adjust amounts.

## Directions

Marinade the chicken 2-12 hrs before cooking. If the breasts are very thick, slice them in half to make them half as thick (or pound them out). Combine all marinade ingredients, and spread over the chicken in a bag or bowl, and refrigerate until ready to cook.

Grill the chicken on medium-high heat. When you take the chicken out of the marinade, let any excessive amounts of marinade drip off, but then baste/brush the chicken with the remaining marinade on top occasionally as it cooks. It should take about 10 min total (flipping once halfway through), but grills vary. Get it to 165F internal temp, then let rest for 5 min before serving.
