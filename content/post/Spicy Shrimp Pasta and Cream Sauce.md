## Ingredients

### Shrimp and pasta

- 1 pound raw peeled and deveined shrimp
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/8 cup parmesan cheese
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 teaspoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 package pasta (linguine are my favorite)

### Cream sauce:

- 3/4 cup white wine (1 mini bottle)
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 2 Tbsp parmesan cheese
- 1/8tsp - 1/4tsp cayenne pepper
- salt and pepper

## Instructions

In a bowl, whisk olive oil, parmesan, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic and red pepper flakes together. Add shrimp to a large ziplock bag, pour marinade over top, then seal bag and shake to coat. Place in the fridge to marinate for at least 30 minutes, up to overnight.

When ready to eat, bring water to boil in a large pot and cook pasta according to directions. While pasta is cooking, heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and marinade (just dump the entire contents of the bag into the pan), then cook shrimp until pink â€“ about 3-4 minutes per side. If excess liquid collects in the pan, spoon it off and save it. Try to just flip the shrimp once: you want some tasty dark fond to form in the pan, but don't let it blacken and burn; add move olive oil if that starts to happen.

Once the shrimp are done, remove them and make the sauce in the pot. First deglaze with white wine, gently scraping the pan with the back of a spoon to dislodge tasty bits. Add reserved liquid, if any. 

Once the wine is simmering and the alcohol smell is gone, add the heavy cream to small bowl. Add spoonfuls of the hot oil to the cream one at a time and stir. This gradually brings the cream up to temp to stop the sauce from breaking. Once the cream bowl is hot, add it to the pan. Continue simmering until the sauce thickens, about 8min. Add cayenne, salt, and pepper to taste. Just before serving, stir in the parmesan cheese. 

Serve shrimp over pasta and spoon the sauce over top.
