## Ingredients

- 2/3 lb salmon
- 2/3 lb green beans
- splash of oil for cooking
- rice

### glaze:
- 3 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp water
- 2 Tbsp rice wine (mirin)
- 2 Tbsp brown sugar
- 1/2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 inch fresh ginger, grated (optional)
- 1 Tbsp sesame seeds
- 1 Tbsp cornstarch

## Directions

Make rice.

Mix all sauce ingredients in a small bowl, stir until cornstarch dissolves.

Cut salmon in to equal-sized steaks, you can leave the skin on if you like it. Place in bowl or bag and cover with half of the sauce. Marinade for ~15 min.

Meanwhile, rinse green beans and snap off ends. Snap big beans in half so pieces are ~1.5in long. Place in a medium saucepan with lukewarm water, cover and bring to a boil for about 3 min. Drain beans.

Heat a non-stick skillet and add splash of oil. Add salmon steaks to pan, but _do not_ add any additional marinade at this point. Cook for ~4 min / side, until almost cooked through. Remove and transfer to a separate plate.

Add beans to the recently-vacated salmon pan and cover with remaining sauce. Cook, stirring frequently, just until sauce thickens and coats beans (~3 min).

Plate rice, beans, and salmon. Salmon skin is edible if you want!
