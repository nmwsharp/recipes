Originally adapted from the excellent New York Times recipe.

## Ingredients

- 1lb cherry/grape tomatoes, halved long-wise (12oz is plenty too)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish
- 1 tsp honey, plus more for garnish
- 1 tsp herbs of choice (thyme, oregano, etc. fresh or dried)
- 15oz can cannellini beans (or other white beans), drained
- 8oz block halloumi cheese, cut to 1/4 inch slices
- 1/4 lemon
- olive oil
- salt and pepper

Makes enough food for 2, can be easily doubled if you have a decent-sized pan. Pairs well with fresh crusty bread. 

## Instructions

Prep ingredients, this cooks pretty fast. Find a wide flat pan which is stovetop-safe and broiler-safe (I use a cast iron pan).  Preheat the oven on broil (low broil setting on my oven), adjusting the top rack to put the pan about 4 inches from the broiler.

Put the pan on the stove at medium heat. Add tomatoes, garlic, parsley, honey, herbs, and a light drizzle of olive oil. Cook until the tomatoes start to get soft, 8-10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Add the drained beans to the pan. Cook about 3 more minutes until beans are hot. Taste-test and adjust seasoning as needed.

Arrange the slices of halloumi into the pan, setting them on top of the mixture flat-wise.

Transfer the pan to the oven, broil for 2-5 minutes until the halloumi gets golden and crispy on top. Broilers vary widely, so watch it carefully during this step.

Remove the pan from the oven. Squeeze the lemon over the pan, and give it another light drizzle of olive oil and honey, then garnish with additional parsley.

Serve like a stew in bowls, ideally with bread for dipping and scooping.
