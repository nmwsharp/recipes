## Ingredients
- 1 lb shrimp 
- 1/4 cup olive oil 
- 1/4 cup cold butter cut into 1 Tbsp chunks 
- 1/2 cup white wine (pinot)
- 2 Tbsp garlic
- 2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 2 Tbsp lemon juice 
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
- salt and pepper
- pasta
- french bread, sliced thin 


## Directions

Thaw and peel your shrimp, then dry them well with paper towels. Put in a sealable bowl and toss with 1/4-1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp baking soda for 15 mins. This makes them plump but sear well when cooking.

Prep ingredients. Cut the butter up but keep in fridge until needed so it stays cold. Chop the parsley and put in a ramekin. Boil water.

Cut your French bread into thin slices and preheat the oven to 350.

In a cast iron, start with a thin layer of olive oil and once hitting light smoke, drop in shrimp. Cook until color is good and then remove to aluminum foil.

Start cooking pasta.

Remove cast iron from the heat, and add 1/3 cup olive oil to cast iron, along with the garlic and red pepper flakes. It should be sizzling good but not burning. Once garlic is fragrant but not overcooked, add in the wine. 

Stir it all together, and then let it simmer well until reduced by about half and the raw alcohol smell is gone.

Cover bread with a light layer of olive oil and put in oven to toast.

Add the cold butter, 1 Tbsp at a time, and CONSTANTLY WHISK. This is what makes the sauce smooth and not watery. After all butter has been introduced, add lemon just and reduce to low heat. The bread will be done at some point around here, don't burn it.

Now, add the shrimp back and toss and coat and put back on heat until just starting to sizzle and warmed again. Add most of the parsley and stir together.

Now, scoot your shrimp over to one half of the cast iron, and put your pasta in the other half. Mix it with the butter/oil mix in the cast iron so it gets a good coat, then put neatly back on its half of the cast iron.
Salt and pepper the pasta, and then sprinkle the last bit of parsley over all of it as a topping. Place the toasted bread around the outer ring of cast iron on top the pasta.

Artfully position the bread around the cast iron pan and take a picture, it will do well on social media.
