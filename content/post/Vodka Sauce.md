Makes about 8 servings. Total time: 2.5 hours.

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 medium onion (spanish/yellow), chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced 
- 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- 1.5 tsp dried oregano
- 1 cup vodka
- two 28-oz cans peeled tomatoes (san marzano work great. you can optionally sub one can for 14oz diced tomatoes)
- 4 Tbsp fresh basil, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- grated parmesean/pecorino romano cheese
- 2 tsp salt
- pinch of black pepper

Optional for serving:

- pasta
- asparagus/mushrooms/sausage (sauteed and added to pasta)


## Directions

Preheat oven to 375F.

Heat olive oil on the stovetop in a large oven-proof pan (dutch oven works great). Cook onions and garlic for 5 min until translucent, then add red pepper flakes and dried oregano and cook for 1 minute more. Add vodka, then cook until mixture is reduced by half (about 5 min).

Drain one can of tomatoes. Add all tomatoes to pan, crushing by-hand as you do so. Also add the juice from just one can of tomatoes.Add salt and pepper to pan.

Cover the pan with a lid and bake in oven for 1.5 hours. If you are making pasta or other add-ins, start them at the end of the cooking time.

Remove pot from oven, then blend with blender/food processor/immersion blender until it is smooth but still has tiny chunks. If you want to be safe, let it cool a bit first, but you should be able to blend it hot. Return the sauce to the pan.

Reheat sauce on stove, add fresh basil, heavy cream, and a generous handful of grated cheese (adjust the amount of cream/cheese to your desired consistency & taste).
