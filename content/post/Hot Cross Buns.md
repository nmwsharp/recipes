Makes 12 rolls. Total time: 3.5 hrs.

## Ingredients

Bread:

- 450g bread flour
- 260ml whole milk
- 50g [4 Tbsp] butter (softened)
- 1 egg
- 10g [3 tsp] instant yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp allspice
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
- 1/4 tsp ground corriander
- 1/4 tsp ground ginger
- 50g white raisins
- 50g dried cranberries
- 50g chopped candied/dried fruit (any, I like oranges)
- zest of one orange
- zest of one lemon

Glaze:

- 35g granulated sugar
- 2 Tbsp water
- 1 Tbsp honey
- 4 cloves
- 1 (small) star anise
- 1 (small) cinnamon stick
- pinch of ground nutmeg

## Directions

Heat the milk to lukewarm (about 105F). Combine milk, flour, yeast, salt, sugar, egg, and spices in a large bowl. As always, take care not to pour the salt directly on the yeast. Mix/knead by hand or with a stand mixer for about 5 minutes, while gradually incorporating softened butter. The dough should be elastic and somewhat sticky when combined.

Add the zests and dried fruit, then mix for about 3 more minutes to combine. You may have to manipulate it by hand a bit to get the fruit well-distributed and inside the dough.

Transfer the dough to a large, covered bowl and let rise for about 1hr, until doubled in size.

Punch the dough down, then turn it out on the counter and form 12 round rolls with a smooth, tight surface. Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the rolls on the sheet. Cover in cling wrap and allow to prove for another 45 min, or until doubled in size.

Heat the oven to 415F. Optionally, make crosses on the buns by combining 100g flour and 100ml water in a piping bag, and piping a small cross on the top of each roll.  Remove the plastic wrap and bake the rolls for 16-20 min, until the outside is starting to turn golden brown.

While the rolls bake, prepare the glaze by combining all ingredients in a small pot over low heat. Stir continuously until the sugar dissolves, then about 5min more until the mixture is slightly syrupy. Set aside.

Take the rolls out of the oven, transfer to a cooling rack, and brush with syrup. Enjoy!
