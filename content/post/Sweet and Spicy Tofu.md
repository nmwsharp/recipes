## Ingredients

Tofu & Marinade

- 1 lb firm tofu
- 3/4 cup tamari
- 1/4 cup dark sesame oil
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 cup cornstarch
- oil for frying (generally a few cups of vegetable oil) 

Sweet & Spicy Sauce

- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/4 cup sriracha (or other chili paste/source of spice)
- 2 Tbs sesame oil
- Sesame seeds (garnish)

## Directions

If needed, press tofu to remove liquid.

Slice tofu in to ~3/4 inch cubes and place in shallow container.  Mix tamari, sesame oil, & sugar and pour mixture over tofu. This doesn't need to marinade for long, a few minutes is fine.

Mix together sauce ingredients and set aside.

Heat oil to 350F in a frying pot. Try to maintain this temperature while frying.

Place cornstarch in a large bowl. Working in small batches, toss marinated tofu blocks in cornstarch to coat, then transfer gently to oil. Fry until golden brown while turning occasionally, 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a towel-lined plate to cool.

To serve, drizzle sauce over tofu and garnish with sesame seeds; goes great with fried rice.
