### Ingredients 

1 package pasta, something small and squiggly (use half-package for less carbs)
2 Tbsp olive oil
12 oz. chicken sausage 
2 Tbsp butter
2 cloves garlic, minced 
8 oz. chopped kale (~1 bunch)
8 kalamata olives, chopped
1/4 cup grated Parmesan 
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper 

### Instructions 

Cook pasta according to package; drop the pasta before before beginning next steps. **Remember to reserve some pasta water.**

Slice chicken sausage, and saute in a large pan with olive oil.

When sausage is browned, add garlic & butter and cook for one minute more.

Add chopped kale, olives, and ~1 cup pasta water to pan with sausage. Lower heat and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes until kale is wilted and has shrunk to an impossibly tiny size.

Remove pan from heat, stir in the cooked & drained pasta, and allow to cool for a few minutes while stirring occasionally. I usually transfer to a separate large mixing bowl at this point (unless the pan you cooked in is truly gigantic).

Once the pasta has cooled, add grated Parmesan, red pepper, and salt/pepper to taste. Stir to combine; ideally the Parmesan should coat the pasta but not melt. Optionally drizzle in a little additional EVOO for extra flavor. Serve immediately.
