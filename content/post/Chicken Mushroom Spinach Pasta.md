## Ingredients

- 1-1.5lb chicken thigh or breast, sliced to thin strips
- 1/2 yellow onion, diced
- 8oz cremini mushrooms, quartered
- 5oz spinach leafs
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese
- 4 cups chicken stock 
- 1 lb farfalle pasta
- olive oil
- salt & pepper

Flavors (use all or any combination of):

- 1/2 tsp hot paprika
- 2tsp fresh or 1tsp dried thyme
- 4 leaves fresh basil, sliced
- 1/2 small lemon, juiced
- 3 Tbs sundried tomatoes, chopped



## Instructions

Find a large pan, steel/nonstick/dutch oven (we will cook the pasta and everything in this pan).

Heat a drizzle of oil in pan over medium-high heat, and saute chicken until cooked through and lightly browned. Season with salt & pepper (and optionally a little lemon juice at the end). Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.

Add onions to pan with some oil, cook for ~4 minutes until translucent. Meanwhile heat/microwave 2C of chicken stock to nearly boiling (half of it, to save time later).

Add mushrooms to pan with onions, cook until they have released their water and browned. Near the end, add garlic, with a little more oil if needed.

Reduce heat to medium. Add the 2C unheated chicken stock to the pan to deglaze. Add the heavy cream, then add the heated chicken stock slowly while stirring (I think this helps keep the cream from breaking...?).

Add the dry pasta to the pot with the chicken stock and mushrooms. Add any spices & herbs (but save lemon/tomatoes for later, if using).

Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender and the liquid is mostly absorbed and thickened. This should take about 5min more than the usual cooking time for the pasta.

Stir in spinach, parmesan cheese, cooked chicken, and any remaining flavors to the pasta. Serve and enjoy!
