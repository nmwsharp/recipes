## Ingredients

**For the chicken:**

- 3 lbs of boneless chicken thighs
- 1/2 cup greek yogurt
- 3 Tbsp lemon juice
- 2 Tbsp white wine vinegar (rice vinegar also works)
- 6 Tbsp neutral oil
- 1 small piece fresh ginger, grated
- 6 Tbsp Sharwoodâ€™s Tandoori Spice (see mix below)
- 1 Tbsp fenugreek leaves
- 2 tsp kosher salt

**Sharwood spice mix:**

- 3 Tbsp paprika (maybe go light on this if your paprika is strong and smokey)
- 1 Tbsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground cloves


**For the sauce:**

- 2 Tbsp neutral oil or ghee
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 1 inch piece of ginger, grated
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- green/red chiles, finely chopped (choose your spice level!) (2 thai birds-eye chiles works well, 1 jalapeno also works)
- 3 Tbsp fresh cilantro, finely chopped, lightly packed
- 1 ounce (28 g) raw cashews (about 15 cashews)
- 1 28oz can whole fire-roasted tomatoes
- 1 Tbsp garam masala
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 0.5 tsp cayenne pepper (to taste)
- 1.5 Tbsp fenugreek leaves
- 1 Tbsp salt
- 0.5 tsp sugar
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 4 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut into pieces


## Instructions

1-24hrs beforehand, marinade the chicken. Slice thighs into 2in pieces. Combine all marinade ingredients, mix with chicken in a large bowl, and refrigerate.

Prep ingredients. Add raw cashews to a small microwave safe bowl with 1/4 cup water. Microwave for about 1min, until cashes are plump and slightly soft. Set aside.

Preheat the oven broiler.

Place a large dutch oven or pot on the stove over medium heat. Add the onion and neutral oil, cook for ~12 min until onion is turning golden. Add ginger and garlic, cook for 2min. Add spices (garam masala, cumin, cayenne, and fenugreek leaves) and cook for 1min more, being careful not to let the spices burn.

Add cashews and their liquid, gently deglaze the pan, then add tomatoes including liquid. Add 1 cup water, sugar, and salt. Use a spoon to roughly crush tomatoes.

Cover, and simmer until liquid has reduced, stirring occasionally, about 40min.

Meanwhile, cook the chicken. Spread the chicken on a greased wire rack with a baking sheet underneath, retaining as much marinade as will stick to the chicken. Adjust an oven rack so the chicken will be ~3in from the broiler. Broil for 8-15min more until browned on top and cooked through, it should be lightly charred in places. No need to flip. Timing can vary significantly based on your oven, keep an eye on it. Remove from oven and set aside. Optionally, chop the chicken into smaller bite-size pieces.
 
Once the sauce is done, remove it from the heat and blend (or immersion blend in-place) until smooth. Add the butter and cream, then blend more until emulsified.

Return sauce to pot. Add chicken and all juices to pot. Add cilantro. Stir and simmer for a few minutes to incorporate. Add adjust with salt/pepper/spice/etc if needed and serve.
