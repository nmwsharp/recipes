## Ingredients

### Spicy Peanut Sauce
- 1/8 cup natural-style peanut butter
- 1 Tbsp sriracha
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp grated fresh ginger
- 1 tsp brown sugar
- 3 Tbsp hot water

### Pork Mixture
- 1/2 lb ground pork, chicken or turkey 
- 8 oz button mushrooms 
- 1 large carrot 
- 1 red bell pepper 
- 2 cloves garlic 
- 1 tsp grated fresh ginger 
- 1/3 cup hoisin sauce 
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce 
- 1 tsp toasted sesame oil 
- 1/2 Tbsp neutral cooking oil 

### Bowl
- 4 cups cooked rice 
- 1/4 cup peanuts, chopped 
- 2-3 green onions, sliced 


## Directions

Make sauce by combining all ingredients in small bowl. Add water slowly until thin enough to drizzle, but no more. Set aside.

Cook rice.

Saute garlic, ginger, and pork in a skillet until pork is cooked through and crumbly, about five minutes. While cooking, clean and chop mushrooms in to small pieces.

Once pork is cooked, add mushrooms to the skillet and continue cooking until they have released their moisture (about 5 min). Meanwhile, shred carrot and dice bell pepper.

Once mushrooms are cooked through, add carrots, bell pepper, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, and sesame oil to the skillet. Stir over heat until combined and heated through.
