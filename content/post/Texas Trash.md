## Notes

Lately I have been adding some black pepper and using a combination of 
roma and regular tomatoes.  You need to have juice so you can't use all 
romas - I also find better to use a little more tomatoes rather than less.

Also, if you find it is too juicy when you take it out of the fridge, simply 
spoon off some liquid.

Things to try:

- Add fresh diced jalapenos?
