## Ingredients

- 1 lb beef stew meat 
- 8 oz mushrooms
- 1 lb carrots
- 1.5 lb potatoes
- 14 oz bag frozen pearl onions
- 2 Tbsp flour
- 2 Tbsp butter
- 2 cups beef broth (bullion works)
- 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1/2 Tbsp brown sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 Tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp dried rosemary
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- Salt and pepper

## Directions

If stew beef is coarsely cut, further cut in to 1/2-in cubes. Toss with flour, salt, and pepper to coat.

Clean and chop all vegetables. Use 1/2-in chunks of potatoes, and 1/4-in chuncks of carrots and mushrooms. Pearl onions can be used directly from frozen bag without thawing.

Melt butter in a large skillet, then add beef and saute. Keep the temperature high and try not to touch it except once to flip. We don't need to cook the beef through, but we do want a good browning on the outside.

Remove beef from pot, then add beef broth to deglaze. Add all spices and sauce to skillet and this point and mix.

Add all ingredients to pressure cooker (or instant pot). Cook on high for 35 minutes (for instant pot, use meat/stew setting). After 35 minutes, let pressure naturally dissipate.

Open steam valve and serve! Bread is a must.
