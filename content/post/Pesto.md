## Ingredients

- 3 cups fresh basil leaves (lightly packed before cutting) 
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley (lightly packed before cutting)
- 1-2 cloves garlic
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese (grated, or chopped into small chunks)
- 1/4 cup pine nuts
- 3/4 cup olive oil
- salt

A food processor is highly recommended, although this can be made by-hand instead if you are willing to patiently chop. Apparently it is traditional to use a mortar & pestle, but I have never tried it.

## Directions

Place basil & parsley in food processor, pulse while occasionally stopping to scrape down sides until they are very finely chopped. Transfer to medium bowl.

Place garlic, parmesan cheese, and pine nuts in food processor. Pulse until they form a fine paste. Add to your medium bowl.

Stir the mixture to combine, gradually drizzling oil until a slightly-wet paste-like consistency is reached. Salt to taste.

Serve with garlic-sauteed chicken over cavatappi pasta and a glass of mid-tier wine while watching Battlestar Galactica.
