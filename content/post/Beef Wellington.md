Originally adapted from the Gordon Ramsay recipe.

## Ingredients

- 2 beef steaks (filet mignon or similar)
- ~1lb button portabello mushrooms 
- 1 large sprig thyme
- 1 tsp grey poupon / dijon mustard
- ~6 slices prosciutto
- 2 sheets puff pastry (thawed if frozen)
- 2 egg yolks
- olive oil

Cling wrap required. Food processor recommended.

## Directions

**Prep:** (at least 4-12hrs before read-to-eat)

Trim excess fat/gristle from the beef steaks if needed. Wrap tightly in cling wrap and return to fridge. You can do this hours ahead of time or just beforehand while you prep the mushrooms.

Wash mushrooms, remove stems, and chop extremely fine, almost a mince, we are making mushroom duxelles. Recommended to use a food processor for this. Also clean and pick leaves from the thyme.

Heat a fairly large metal frying pan on the stove over medium-high heat, with a drizzle of olive oil (or high-heat oil if you have it handy). Sear the steaks on all sides, about 1min per side. We are not trying to cook the steaks, just sear the outside. Remove steaks and set aside to cool.

Add the mushroom mix to the same pan, drizzle with more olive oil, reduce heat to medium. Cook the mushrooms for 5-10 min until they have released their moisture and it has evaporated. Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper, and add the thyme leaves. Cook for another 3-5 more min until the mushrooms are very dry and have seared a bit. Remove from the mushrooms from heat and spread thin on a plate to cool.

Once the steaks and mushrooms are both cool, assemble the Wellingtons one at a time as follows: Lay out a large sheet of cling wrap. Lay out ~3 slices of prosciutto on the wrap, overlapping slightly (about the right size to wrap around the steak). Spread a layer of the mushroom duxelles over the prosciutto, about 1/4 inch thick. Take each steak, season with salt and pepper, and brush with a thin layer of mustard (very thin, go extremely light!). Place the steak on top of the mushroom layer, then wrap the prosciutto-mushroom around the steak, using the cling wrap to help you roll it tightly. Twist the ends of the cling wrap to seal. If necessary, add another layer of cling wrap to tightly compress the delicious brick of flavor.


**Cook:** (~1hr+15min before read-to-eat)

Prepare an egg wash by whisking the egg yolks with a tablespoon of water (don't discard, you will need it twice!).

Warp each Wellington in puff pastry: take out a sheet of puff pastry, roll it out slightly on a floured surface. Remove the cling wrap from one Wellington and place it in the pastry. Wrap the pastry around the Wellington, trimming away excess, and brushing with egg wash at the sealing points to seal. Wrap tightly in cling wrap again and place in fridge for another 15-30min to firm up. Repeat for the second Wellington.

Preheat oven to 400F.

Remove the Wellingtons from the fidge and unwrap. Score the tops, and brush with the egg wash on all sides. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil + non-stick spray. Bake for 15-20min until the pastry is golden-brown. If it makes you feel better, you can temp-check the steaks for doneness to ensure they are medium-rare (120-125F).  

Let stand for 10min before slicing and serving.
