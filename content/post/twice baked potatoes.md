# Ingredients

- 8 potatoes 
- 2 sticks of butter
- 1 cup Sour Cream
- milk (if necessary)
- ~2 cups Cheddar/Jack Cheese
- ~1/2 cup Bacon Bits
- 5 green onions (chopped)
- 2 tsp Lawryâ€™s Seasoned Salt
- 1 tsp garlic salt
- 1 tsp onion powder
- black pepper

# Directions

Bake potatoes at 400 for 1:15 or until cooked through.

Halve the potatoes and scoop out the insides, try to preserve the skins. Mix the potato innards with all of the other ingredients (using only half of the cheese).

Scoop the mix back in to the skins and bake at 350 for 15-20 min. Top with remaining cheese.
