## Ingredients

- 1.5 lbs whitefish fillets (hake, cod, flounder, etc)
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme (divided)
- 3 bell peppers, mix of colors, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup black or green olives, pitted and sliced
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 cup parsley loosely packed parsley, chopped
- 1 tsp sherry vinegar
- olive oil

Recommended serving accompaniment: saffron rice.

## Directions

Preheat oven to 400F.

Finely chop 1 sprig's worth of thyme leaves. Season the fish with salt, pepper, and chopped thyme. Let the fish rest at room temperature while you prep peppers.

Chop the peppers, toss with 1.5 Tbsp olive and salt + pepper. Spread on a foil-lined baking sheet, and top with remaining thyme leaves. Roast the peppers in the oven, tossing occasionally, until softened, 15-20min.

Increase oven temp to 500F. Push peppers to the side and place fish in the center of pan, drizzling with oil. Scatter olives on top of fish and peppers. Roast fish until cooked through, 6-10min.

Meanwhile, make a vinaigrette from vinegar, garlic, pinch of salt, and 3 Tbsp olive oil. Whisk in parsley. Taste and adjust as needed.

Serve fish over the peppers, drizzling with the vinaigrette.
