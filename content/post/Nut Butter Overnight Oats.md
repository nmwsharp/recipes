## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup almond milk
- 1/2 cup old fashioned oats
- 1 Tbsp chia seeds (optional, use a little less almond milk if omitting)
- 2 Tbsp nut butter
- 1 Tbsp honey
- 1/4 tsp vanilla


## Instructions

Makes a single-serving portion. Scale to as many as you need.

Recommended to prepare each portion in a small single-serving mason jar or similar small bowl.

Mix all ingredients together, stir as best you can. Cover, and refrigerate overnight, then eat from the jar cold. Can be kept in fridge for up to 2 days before eating, though it will get more mushy.
