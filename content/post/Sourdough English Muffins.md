Adapted from the King Arthur recipe.

## Ingredients


- 1 Tbsp (12g) granulated sugar
- 1 Cups (227g) warm water
- 1/2 Tbsp yeast (active dry or instant)
- 1/2 Cup (113g) sourdough starter (fed or discard works)
- 3.5 Cups (420g) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup (28g) nonfat dry milk
- 2 Tbsp (28g) butter, room temperature
- 1/2 Tbsp (9g) salt
- 1/8 tsp citric acid (optional)
- semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

Electric griddle or similar for cooking.

## Directions

Combine all ingredients (except semolina) in a large bowl or mixer.

Knead by hand or with electric mixer until a smooth, soft, elastic dough forms (5-10 min). It should be only slightly sticky, and clear the sides of a bowl; add more flour if needed.

Transfer to a bowl and cover. To bake immediately: let rise for 1.5 hrs. To bake tomorrow, immediately place the fridge and chill for 12-24 hours.

Turn out the dough, work it gently to mix and deflate, and let sit for 10 minutes to relax. Prepare a baking sheet with some parchment paper, dusted with semolina flour.

Flour your work surface (I use all-purpose flour for this). Roll the dough into a thick cylinder about 16 inches long. Use a bench knife or anything to slice 12 hockey pucks of dough, transferring each to the baking sheet and dusting the flat sides with semolina flour. The pucks will try to crumple as you cut them, just do your best and flatten the sides back into pucks after each cut.

Cover the sheet of pucks, and let rise until lightly puffy. This should take about 45 min if you are baking same-day, or 2hrs if the dough was refrigerated overnight.

Preheat an electric griddle to 325F (be wary, griddles can vary widely, cook times here might be faster or slower). Transfer the muffins to the griddle, and cook on the first side for 5 min. Then, place a sheet of parchment paper on top of the muffins, and set a baking sheet on top of that to squish them gently. Cook for 5 more min. (If the bottoms start burning, shorten this step.)

Remove the baking sheet / paper, and flip the muffins. Cook for another 5 min or so, until both sides are browned and the interior hits 190F.

Transfer to a rack to cool for at least 20min before eating. Split them in half with a fork and toast w/ butter and jam. They will keep for about 5 days in an airtight container.
