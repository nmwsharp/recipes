## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground chicken
- 1 cup ricotta cheese
- 1 egg
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup cilantro, finely chopped
- zest of 1 lemon
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tbsp olive oil

## Directions

Add all ingredients (except oil) to a bowl, and mix until combined. Form into ~1.5in diameter meatballs, and flatten each a bit so it has a cylindrical-ish shape.

Heat a large pan with oil over medium heat. Add meatballs in batches, and cook while turning occasionally, until browned on all sides and cooked through (about 10min, check temp to 165F). They should get a tasty dark crust on the outside but not totally blacken.
