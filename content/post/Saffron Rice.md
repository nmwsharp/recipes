## Ingredients

- 1/4 tsp saffron threads
- 1 small yellow onion, minced
- 2 cups of white rice (NOT ricecooker cups, which are actually 3/4 cup)
- 2.75 cups chicken stock
- 3/4 tsp salt
- olive oil

Beware cheap knockoff saffron. I buy it at costco, it ends up being very cheap given the small portion needed.

## Instructions

Chop onion, then add to a large pot (or saute pan, if using rice cooker) along with ~1 Tbsp olive oil. Cook for ~10min, until onion is soft and beginning to brown.

Meanwhile, take half the saffron, and grind it to a fine powder using either a mortar & pestel or a spoon in a small bowl. Add the other half of the saffron, uncrushed. Heat 1/4 cup water (should be hot but not boiling, doesn't need to be too precise), and combine it with the saffron. Let it soak during the next steps.

Also meanwhile, rinse the rice, and let the water drain out.

Once the onion is ready, add the rice to the onion, along with an additional ~1 Tbsp olive oil. Cook on high for ~1min more while stirring frequently to toast rice.

If using a rice cooker, transfer mixture to the rice cooker bowl.

Add the saffron including soaking liquid, chicken stock, and salt to the rice, then mix to combine.

If cooking in pot, bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to low heat for 20 min + 10 min more uncovered, until liquid is fully absorbed.

If cooking in rice cooker, use the usual white rice setting.
