## Ingredients

Tangzhong:

- 2 Tbs bread flour
- 2 Tbs water
- 4 Tbs whole milk

Bread Dough:

- 320g [2.5 cups] bread flour
- 1 Tbs active dry yeast 
- 3/4 tsp sea salt
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 3 Tbs unsalted butter, softened
- 1 egg, room temperature

Egg wash:

- one egg
- splash of whole milk 

## Directions

Total time: 4-5 hours

Take egg out of fridge to warm.

Make tangzhong by combining all ingredients in a small saucepan and whisking rapidly over low heat. Once the mixture comes together to a thick paste, transfer to a bowl and allow to cool during next steps.

Warm milk to ~90F (slightly above room temperature), then add yeast and mix. Allow to sit for ~10 min while proceeding with next step.

Make dough by combining bread flour, salt, and sugar in a mixing bowl. Whisk together, then add milk/yeast and tangzong. Mix hand & knead (with dough hook if using mixer) until it comes together, scraping sides as needed.

Add in butter a little at a time, while mixing on medium-low. Once butter is all incorporated, knead (on medium) for ~5 min.

Prepare a bowl greased with butter. Turn dough on to counter, form in to boule with circular motions, then let rise in greased bowl covered with damp towel for 1-2 hrs.

Once dough has roughly doubled in size, prepare a greased baking pan (I use a 9in round pan). Turn dough out on to counter and punch down. Split dough in to 9 equal sized lumps, and roll each in to a happy round ball. Pack in pan, cover with damp towel, and let proof for another 1-2 hours.

Preheat oven to 350F. Once rolls have expanded about 1.5x, brush with egg wash. Bake for 25-30 min, until golden brown on top. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle salt on top.
