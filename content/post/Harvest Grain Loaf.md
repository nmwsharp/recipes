## Ingredients

**Bread:**

- 2.5 cup (300g) bread flour
- 0.5 cup (57g) wheat flour
- 1 tbsp (8g) King Arther Whole Grain Bread Improver
- 0.5 cup (74g) King Arthur Harvest Grains Blend
- 1.5 tsp (9g) salt
- 2.5 Tbsp (28g) granulated sugar OR 2Tbsp (20g) honey
- 2 tsp instant yeast
- 0.25 cup (28g) dry milk or nonfat dry milk
- 1.25 cups (283g) lukewarm water
- 3 Tbsp (43g) butter OR 3 Tbsp (35g) vegetable oil


**Compound Butter** (optional) :

- 1/2 stick of butter
- 1tsp salt (if unsalted butter)

any combination of:

- 1 small clove garlic
- 2 leaves sage
- small sprig rosemary
- 2 sprigs thyme


## Directions

Heat water to lukewarm in a small bowl, add yeast and stir; it should bubble slightly after a few min.

Combine all dry ingredients in a mixing bowl.

Add oil and honey (if using) to water/yeast mixture. Stir and add to bowl with dry ingredients.

Mix & knead, either using an electric mixer or by hand, until the dough is smooth and elastic. You may need to add a bit more flour to get it to come together.

Put the dough in a bowl, cover, and let rise for 1hr until it is puffy but not quite doubled.

Flop the dough onto the counter and deflate it. Grease a loaf pan, shape the bread, and put it in the pan. Let it rise for 1-1.5hrs more, until crowning over the rim. Preheat the oven to 350F. If making butter, let it come to room temperature.

Bake for 35 minutes, until the interior registers 190F. Take it out and transfer to a rack to cool.

To make the herb butter, finely chop all mix-ins and mash into butter.
