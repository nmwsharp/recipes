## Ingredients

- 1 large bunch Chinese broccoli (aka "gai lan")
- 2 Tbsp avocado oil (or other high-heat oil)
- 1 Tbsp minced garlic
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- salt

## Directions

Boil water in a medium saucepan.

Prep the broccoli. Separate the thick parts of the stems in one pile, and the leaves and thin stems in another pile. Cut both in to ~1inch pieces. 

Rinse the broccoli, continuing to keep leaves and stems separate. Dry the leaves a bit if possible, so they aren't extremely wet.

Par-boil the stems. Place them in the boiling water for ~5 min, until slightly tender. Drain.

Place a wok or skillet over high heat and preheat the avocado oil until shimmering. Add the drained stems and saute for ~5 minutes until bright green and starting to brown in parts.

Add the broccoli leaves to the wok. Keep everything moving in the wok until the leaves cook down. Saute the leaves for ~3 minutes, until they their initial liquid is cooked off and they are starting to sizzle. Add the garlic and cook for 2 more minutes.

Salt the broccoli to taste (use a lot, it should be a bit salty!). Lightly drizzle on sesame oil. Toss one last time to combine, then serve immediately.
