## Ingredients

**Shrimp:**

- 1lb medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 2 Tbsp adobo sauce from a can of chipotle adobo chiles
- 2 Tbsp honey
- vegetable or other cooking oil

**Garlic Mayo:**
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1 garlic clove
- salt

**Tacos:**
- 8 corn or flour tortillas
- [optional] 1/4 head of cabbage (or slaw mix)
- [optional] 1 avocado

**Notes:**

Favorite brands of chipotle adobo chiles: Embasa.

We usually use 3-4 shrimp per taco with typical small taco-sized tortillas. Do the math to make sure your tortilla : shrimp ratio works out.

Recommended: make this with black bean summer salsa as an additional taco topping. 

## Directions

Mix adobo sauce and honey in medium bowl, add shrimp and season with salt. Set aside momentarily.

Make the garlic mayo: in a small bowl, mix mayonnaise with 2Tbsp water, grate in the garlic clove, and season with salt.

If using, chop cabbage finely like a slaw, reserve as a topping. Slice avocado.

Heat a large nonstick pan over medium-high. Warm each tortilla briefly in the pan, covering the tortillas to keep warm.

Add 2Tbsp oil to pan, then pour the entire shrimp mixture in. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally and flipping halfway through, until shrimp are curled up and cooked-through. The sauce should reduce somewhat. Honey smells funny when it cooks, don't worry.

Transfer shrimp to a bowl and drizzle in the sauce left in the pan. Serve everything, building tacos from shrimp, slaw, and mayo.
