## Ingredients

1 small can CHOPPED black olives (maybe more?)
1 small can green chiles
2 large tomatoes - chopped
4 or 5 green onions - chopped
3 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 1/2 tsp Garlic salt

## Directions

Mix and chill

Serve with tortilla chips.

Lately I have been adding some black pepper and using a combination of 
roma and regular tomatoes.  You need to have juice so you can't use all 
romas - I also find better to use a little more tomatoes rather than less.

Also, if you find it is too juicy when you take it out of the fridge, simply 
spoon off some liquid.

Things to try:

    - Add fresh diced jalepenos?
