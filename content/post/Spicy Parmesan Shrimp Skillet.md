## Ingredients

### Shrimp and pasta

- 1 pound raw peeled and deveined shrimp
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/8 cup parmesan cheese
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 teaspoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 package pasta (linguine are my favorite)
- sliced green onion (garnish)

### Cream sauce:

- 3/4 cup white wine (1 mini bottle)
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1 Tbsp butter
- 2 Tbsp parmesan cheese
- 1/8tsp - 1/4tsp cayenne pepper
- salt and pepper

## Instructions

In a bowl, whisk olive oil, parmesan, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic and red pepper flakes together. Add shrimp to a large ziplock bag, pour marinade over top, then seal bag and shake to coat. Place in the fridge to marinate for at least 30 minutes, up to overnight.

When ready to eat, bring water to boil in a large pot and cook pasta according to directions. While pasta is cooking, heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and marinade (just dump the entire contents of the bag into the pan), then cook shrimp until pink â€“ about 3-4 minutes per side. If you cook for too long, the brown sugar from the marinade will start to blacken and smoke, this is bad! 

Once the shrimp are done, remove them and make the sauce in the pot. First deglaze with white wine, gently scraping the pan with the back of a spoon to dislodge tasty bits. Add heavy cream, and simmer until somewhat thickened and alcohol smell is gone, about 8min. Season with cayenne, salt, and pepper to taste. Just before serving, stir in the parmesan cheese and butter. 

Serve shrimp over past and spoon sauce over top.
