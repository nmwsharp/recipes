This is a copycat recipe of an incredible dish at the restaurant Joule in Seattle, WA.

This makes a large 6+ person portion and probably requires cooking in two batches. Consider making a half recipe.

Pairs well with scallion pancakes and sauteed Chinese broccoli.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb chorizo sausage (not in casings, if possible)
- 2 lbs Korean rice cakes (prefer refrigerated over frozen, and if-possible get the thin sliced medallions, not the cylinders)
- 1 bunch kale, chopped
- 3 green onions, thinly sliced (garnish)
- sesame seeds (garnish)
- canola oil or vegetable oil
- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup gochujang (if you use 'medium' heat this will be quite spicy, consider 'mild')
- 1/2 cup mirin
- 1/2 cup sake (or rice cooking wine)
- 3 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp ginger, grated
- 1 tsp garlic, minced

## Directions

Soak the rice cakes in a bowl of water for 1hr, breaking apart clumps as needed.

Make the sauce by whisking together gochujang, mirin, sake, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic.

Remove the sausage from its casings if needed. Break the sausage into thumb-sized chunks, pressing them flat with thin edge that can get nice and crispy.

Drain the rice cakes. Heat a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat, with a thin layer of canola oil. Once it his hot, add some chorizo in the center of the pan, then rice cakes along the outside. Depending on the size of your pan, you may need to only do half of each and do two batches.

Let the chorizo and rice cakes cook for 3 min untouched. Then break them up, flip, and let them set for 3 more min. Finally, toss them and cook again for 3 more min (9-10 min total cook time). The chorizo should be cooked through, with crispy bits forming at the edges. The rice cakes will try very hard to stick to your pan, you may have to scrape a bit, and add more oil if-needed.

Once the chroizo is looking crispy, add the water, sauce, and kale (if working in two batches, add half of the water, sauce, and kale to each batch). Cook, stirring occasionally, until the kale wilts and sauce thickens, about 5 min.

Transfer to a serving bowl and top with green onions and sesame seeds.
