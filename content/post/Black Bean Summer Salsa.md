## Ingredients

- 1 (15oz) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 (11oz) can sweet corn, drained
- 4 roma (or other) tomatoes, seeded and chopped
- 1 red/orange/yellow bell pepper, diced
- 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
- 2 avocados, diced
- 1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1/4 cup fresh lime juice (1-2 limes)
- 1 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Directions

Prep and combine all ingredients in a medium bowl. The avocado will mush in a bit, that is intended. If possible, cover and chill for 2hrs before serving, but you can also serve immediately.

Use a topping for tacos, eat with chips, enjoy it however you want!
