## Ingredients

- 2 boxes Jiffy cornbread muffin mix
- 2 eggs
- 1/3 cup milk
- 1 can creamed corn
- 2 tbs Sugar
- 1 tbs butter (to grease skillet)

## Directions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Find a cast iron skillet.

Combine all ingredients in bowl. Mix and allow to sit for a few minutes.

Place the skillet in the oven for a few minutes to allow it to warm up. Take out the skillet and coat the inside with butter (or fat). Then pour in the batter (it should sizzle!) and return the skillet to the oven. Bake for 25-35 minutes, until the top of the cornbread is brown and cracking. Remember to clean the skillet as soon as possible to prevent rusting.
