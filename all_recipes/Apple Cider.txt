Aunt Nan's Spiced Apple Cider

1/2 gal 	Apple Cider
1 cup 	    Pineapple Juice
1/2         fresh orange, sliced (with peel)
1/8 cup 	Lemon Juice (maybe a little less. Use a LOT less if squeezing fresh lemons)
2 			cinnamon sticks
1 tsp 		whole cloves
1/2         ground (or smashed) nutmeg 

Combine all ingredients and heat. The spices will get stronger over the next few hours,
I suggest waiting at least 2 hours to drink. Strain it out to pour in to cups.  

Make sure it's hot but not too hot. If there is A LOT of steam coming off of the pot
then the water is evaporating too fast and it will quickly get syrupy.

Candidate additions:
- Brown sugar
- Allspice
- Salt
