Rice cooker rice with Chinese sausage

Ingredients:

3 cups (rice cooker cups) white rice
1/2 package Chinese sausage (maybe 1/2 lb ish?)
2 cups frozen mixed veggies (peas/corn/carrots/etc)
2 cups broccoli
2.5 tbs soy sauce
1 tsp sesame oil
3 tbs sriracha
other spices as desired


Directions:

    - Begin cooking rice the usual way (rinse it, you fool!)
    - Slice chinese sausage, add it to a bowl to marinade with all off the sauces/spices combined
    - Steam frozen veggies. Don't worry about fully cooking them, but you want them to be warm. Add veggies to marinading bowl.
    - Rinse/cut broccoli
    - When 10 min are left on rice cooker, add sausage/veggie/sauce mixture and stir. Set broccoli above to steam.
    - Eat, be happy.

Ideas:

    - Chicken stock instead of water with rice?
    - Might need to cook broccoli separate to get it to be done
    - other spices? fish sauce?
