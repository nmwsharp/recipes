Peppermint Bark

Ingredients:

10 ounces dark chocolate (morsels work great)

10 ounces white chocolate (morsels work great)

2 teaspoons vegetable oil (flavorless oil)

4 candy cane's worth of ground up candy canes. Peppermints probably also work.


Instructions:

Line a cookie sheet with alumnimun foil. This recipe makes about the right amount
for about half of a standard baking sheet. Consider a double recipie.

Melt dark chocolate with 1 tsp vegetable oil. I suggest the microwave (see note at bottom)
unless you have a double boiler.

Spread dark chocolate in the cookie sheet. Place in refridgerator until set, about 30 min.

Melt white chocolate with 1 tsp vegetable oil. I suggest the microwave (see note at bottom)
unless you have a double boiler.

Spread white chocolate in the cookie sheet on top of dark. Quickly sprinkle crushed candy cane
on top, pressing lightly to get it to stick. Place in refridgerator until set, about 30 min.
