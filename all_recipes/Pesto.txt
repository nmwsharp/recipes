Pesto

Ingredients:

3 cups (lightly packed before cutting) fresh basil leaves
1/2 cup (lightly packed before cutting) fresh parsley
4 cloves garlic (maybe 3?)
1/2 cup grated Parmessan cheese
3/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup pine nuts

Directions:

Pretty self explanatory. Chop everything up super fine, with a 
processor if you have one, or by hand if you're a real man. 
Combine all.

Serving suggestions:

Serve with garlic-sauteed chicken over cavatappi pasta and a glass
of mid-tier wine while watching Battlestar Galactica.
