      <description>Ingredients  1 small can chopped black olives 1 small can green chiles 2 large tomatoes (diced) 4 green onions (chopped) 3 Tbsp Olive Oil 1 1&amp;frasl;2 tsp Garlic salt  Directions Mix and chill.
Serve with tortilla chips.
Notes Lately I have been adding some black pepper and using a combination of roma and regular tomatoes. You need to have juice so you can&amp;rsquo;t use all romas - I also find better to use a little more tomatoes rather than less.</description>
