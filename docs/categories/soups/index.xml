      <description>Modified from a recipe in the &amp;ldquo;That Sounds So Good&amp;rdquo; cookbook by Carla Lalli Music, which I highly recommend.
Cook time: 20min prep the day before. 4hrs day-of (mostly inactive).
Makes 8+ servings. Bake some bread to go with it.
Ingredients 3lb bone-in pork shoulder/butt, or ~2lb boneless (less is okay) 1lb dry black eyed peas (or other small white beans) 2 large carrots 1 medium onion (or ~8oz frozen pearl onions) 6 cloves of garlic small handful of thyme springs olive oil for drizzling 1 Tbsp sherry vinegar or red/white wine vinegar 2 tsp paprika (if possible, smoked hot paprika) 1 tsp cayenne pepper 2 tsp chili powder 2 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander 2 bay leafs (optional) 1/2 tsp MSG salt &amp;amp; pepper NOTE: this recipe requires a large pot such as a dutch oven which is both stove-safe and oven-safe at 325F.</description>
