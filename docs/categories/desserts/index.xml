Strain it out to pour in to cups.&#xA;Make sure it&amp;rsquo;s hot but not too hot (I use roughly 175F).</description>

      <description>Ingredients 10 ounces dark chocolate (morsels work great) 10 ounces white chocolate (morsels work great) 2 teaspoons vegetable oil (flavorless oil) 4 candy cane&amp;rsquo;s worth of ground up candy canes (Peppermints probably also work) Instructions Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil. This recipe makes about the right amount for about half of a standard baking sheet. Consider a double recipe.&#xA;Melt dark chocolate with 1 tsp vegetable oil. I suggest the microwave (see note at bottom) unless you have a double boiler.</description>
